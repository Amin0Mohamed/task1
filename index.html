         <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing<br /> pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a <br />complete account of the system, and             expound the actual teachings of the<br /> great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
          dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because<br /> it is         pleasure,      but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure 
          rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.<br />
